  <div class="first">
    <h1> In the beginning - I was a scared but eager coding student, just learning HTML, and soon after CSS.
      My first project was just learning an h1 tag and changing the background color in CSS.
      Now I use bootstrap and get some color choices from W3schools, I can style a page with ease.
      The struggles of missing just that one space or just adding some really cool CSS and nothing happens, we’ve all been there but it’s a learning process and I’ve had some really great teachers show me how it’s done and how to improve.

    <h1> Then I fell in love with programming and being able to make a website from scratch, it was so much typing on a keyboard and trying new things to see what they did.
      I havent thought about doing anything else, this is where I belong.
      Making websites for companies and businesses.

                also found that you could link a video to an image and figured it was cool enought to add a video of me at work.</p>
